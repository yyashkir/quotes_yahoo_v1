BUY   if TS > 0    and P < MA * (1 - PD)
SELL  if TS <= 0 and P > MA * (1 + PR)
WAIT otherwise

	"Trade LINEAR"
BUY   if TS > 0 and P  <  LA  * (1 - PD)
SELL  if TS > 0 and P >= LA * (1 + PR)
WAIT otherwise

	"Trade UPDOWN"
BUY   if  P  <  P(at start) * (1 - PD)
SELL  if  P  > P(at start) * (1 + PR)
WAIT otherwise

Monitor mode "Monitor":
For the latest stock price all three above criteria are calculated and displayed.

WARNING!
The backtesting modes are designed for research purposes (mainly, to identify best parameters).
